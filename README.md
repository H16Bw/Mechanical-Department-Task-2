# Designing Head Joints for a Robot 
The objective is to design Head joints for the Robot that allow it to achieve the desired motion, using two types of joints: the pivot joint and, the ball and socket joint. These joints are to be integrated with DC motors and programmed with sensors using Arduino.

The integration of Arduino enables control over the motors and allows the robot to respond to environmental stimuli, helping it achieve specific motion objectives.

## Pivot Joint:

The pivot joint facilitates rotational motion around a single axis, allowing the robot's head to tilt up and down or rotate left and right. The neck joint is located within the robot's body, and it enables movement using two electric DC motorsâ€”one for the X-direction and another for the Y-direction. When the robot needs to move towards a specific angle between the two axes, these motors work in tandem to achieve the desired motion.

## Ball and Socket Joint:

The ball and socket joint provides the robot's head with the capability of a wide range of motion in multiple axes, granting it the freedom to move in all directions. The joint consists of a ball-shaped end that fits into a socket, facilitating rotation and tilting movements. In this design, the ball part is integrated into the robot's head, while the socket is a component of the neck. By utilizing electric DC motors, the robot's head can move in various orientations depending on how the motors are activated.
